Anarchism calls for the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]] which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful. It is usually described alongside [[libertarian Marxism]] as the [[libertarian]] wing ([[libertarian socialism]]) of the [[socialist movement]] and as having a historical association with [[anti-capitalism]] and [[socialism]].\\n\\nI\\'m sorry to bug you, but thank you for checking anarchism out!\\n\\nThe [[history of anarchism]] goes back to [[prehistory]], when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, [[realm]]s or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers\\' struggles for [[emancipation]]. Various [[anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.\\n\\nAnarchism employs a [[diversity of tactics]] in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. There is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, having taken a violent turn in the past. Evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent, violent and utopian.\\n{{toc limit|3}}\\n\\n== Etymology, terminology and definition ==\\n{{main|Definition of anarchism and libertarianism}}\\n{{see also|Glossary of anarchism}}\\nThe etymological origin of \\'\\'anarchism\\'\\' is from the Ancient Greek \\'\\'anarkhia\\'\\', meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix \\'\\'an-\\'\\' (i.e. \"without\") and the word \\'\\'arkhos\\'\\' (i.e. \"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix \\'\\'[[-ism]]\\'\\' denotes the ideological current that favours [[anarchy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bates|1y=2017|1p=128|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2p=217}} \\'\\'Anarchism\\'\\' appears in English from 1642 as \\'\\'anarchisme\\'\\' and \\'\\'anarchy\\'\\' from 1539; early English usages empahised a sense of disorder.{{sfnm|1a1=Merriam-Webster|1y=2019|1loc=\"Anarchism\"|2a1=\\'\\'Oxford English Dictionary\\'\\'|2y=2005|2loc=\"Anarchism\"|3a1=Sylvan|3y=2007|3p=260}} Various factions within the [[French Revolution]] labelled their opponents as \\'\\'anarchists\\'\\', although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as [[William Godwin]] (1756–1836) and [[Wilhelm Weitling]] (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use \\'\\'anarchist\\'\\' or \\'\\'anarchism\\'\\' in describing themselves or their beliefs.{{sfn|Joll|1964|pp=27–37}}\\n\\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an \\'\\'anarchist\\'\\' ({{lang-fr|anarchiste}}) was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France,{{sfn|Nettlau|1996|p=162}} \\'\\'[[libertarianism]]\\'\\' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism{{sfn|Guérin|1970|loc=\"The Basic Ideas of Anarchism\"}} and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Ward|1y=2004|1p=62|2a1=Goodway|2y=2006|2p=4|3a1=Skirda|3y=2002|3p=183|4a1=Fernández|4y=2009|4p=9}} On the other hand, some use \\'\\'libertarianism\\'\\' to refer to [[individualistic]] [[free-market]] philosophy only, referring to [[free-market anarchism]] as \\'\\'libertarian anarchism\\'\\'.{{sfn|Morris|2002|p=61}}\\n\\nWhile the term \\'\\'libertarian\\'\\' has been largely synonymous with anarchism,{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Cohn|2y=2009|2p=6}} its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups,{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} including both the [[New Left]] and [[libertarian Marxists]] (who do not associate themselves with [[authoritarian socialists]] or a [[vanguard party]]) as well as extreme [[Liberalism|liberals]] (primarily concerned with [[civil liberties]]).{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Additionally, some anarchists use \\'\\'[[libertarian socialist]]\\'\\'{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1992|1p=641|2a1=Chomsky|2y=2005|2p=123|3a1=Cohn|3y=2009|3p=6|4a1=Adams|4a2=Levy|4y=2018|4p=104}} to avoid anarchism\\'s negative connotations and emphasise its connections with [[socialism]].{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} Matthew S. Adams and [[Carl Levy (political scientist)|Carl Levy]] write that \\'\\'anarchism\\'\\' is used to \"describe the [[anti-authoritarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]]\".{{sfn|Adams|Levy|2018|p=104}} Similarly, [[Noam Chomsky]] describes anarchism, alongside libertarian Marxism, as \"the libertarian wing of socialism\".{{sfn|Chomsky|2005|p=123}} [[Daniel Guérin]] wrote:\\n<blockquote>[A]narchism is really a synonym for socialism. The anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man. Anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought, that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the State.{{sfn|Guérin|1970|p=12}}</blockquote>\\n\\nWhile [[opposition to the state]] is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently.{{sfn|Long|2013|p=217}} Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing [[authority]] and [[hierarchical organisation]] (including [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]], [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], the [[State (polity)|state]]  and all associated [[institution]]s) in the conduct of all [[human relations]] in favour of a society based on [[decentralisation]], [[freedom]] and [[voluntary association]]. However, this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on anti-authoritarianism (which is an \\'\\'[[a posteriori]]\\'\\' conclusion), anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that){{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1p=166|2a1=Jun|2y=2009|2p=507|3a1=Franks|3y=2013|3pp=386–388}} and etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler).{{sfnm|1a1=McLaughlin|1y=2007|1pp=25–29|2a1=Long|2y=2013|2pp=217}} Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the will for a non-coercive society, the rejection of the state apparatus, the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non-coercive society and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy.{{sfn|McLaughlin|2007|pp=25–26}}\\n\\n[[Herbert L. Osgood]] claimed that anarchism is \"the extreme antithesis\" of [[authoritarian communism]] and [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Osgood|1889|p=1}} [[Peter Marshall (author)|Peter Marshall]] states that \"[i]n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism. [...] Anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. It cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine\".{{sfn|Marshall|1992|p=641}} According to [[Jeremy Jennings]], \"[i]t is hard not to conclude that these ideas\", referring to [[anarcho-capitalism]], \"are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is\". Jennings adds that \"anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual (as the \\'anarcho-capitalists\\' appear to believe) but, as we have already seen, for the extension of individuality and community\".{{sfn|Jennings|1999|p=147}} [[Nicolas Walter]] wrote that \"anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically. [...] In a sense, anarchists always remain liberals and socialists, and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself. [...] We are liberals but more so, and socialists but more so\".{{sfn|Walter|2002|p=44}} Michael Newman includes anarchism as one of many [[socialist traditions]], especially the more socialist-aligned tradition following Proudhon and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].{{sfn|Newman|2005|p=15}} [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morriss]] argues that it is \"conceptually and historically misleading\" to \"create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism\".{{sfn|Morriss|2015|p=64}}\\n\\n== History ==\\n{{main|History of anarchism}}\\n\\n=== Pre-modern era ===\\n[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|[[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BC), whose \\'\\'[[Republic (Zeno)|Republic]]\\'\\' inspired [[Peter Kropotkin]]{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=70}}]]\\nDuring the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction.{{sfn|Graham|2005|pp=xi–xiv}} Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, [[philosophical anarchism]] (i.e. the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by [[Taoist]] philosophers [[Zhuang Zhou]] and [[Laozi]].{{sfnm|1a1=Coutinho|1y=2016|2a1=Marshall|2y=1993|2p=54}} Taoism alongside [[stoicism]] have been said to have had \"significant anticipations\" of anarchism.{{Sfn|Sylvan|2007|p=257}}\\n\\nAnarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]] used the myth of [[Antigone]] to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal [[autonomy]]. [[Socrates]] questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience. [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] dismissed human law (\\'\\'[[Nomos (sociology)|nomos]]\\'\\') and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (\\'\\'[[physis]]\\'\\'). [[Stoics]] were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.{{sfn|Marshall|1993|pp=4, 66–73}}\\n\\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the [[Muslim world]] or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to [[religious anarchism]]. In the [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Mazdak]] called for an [[egalitarian]] society and the [[abolition of monarchy]], only to be soon executed by Emperor [[Kavad I]].{{sfn|Marshall|1993|p=86}}\\n\\nIn [[Basra]], religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the [[Renaissance]] with the spread of [[humanism]], [[rationalism]] and [[reason]]ing through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based on voluntarism rather than coercion.

This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust [[hierarchy]], or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives.{{sfn|Williams|2018|pp=4–5}}  Decision-making is often handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as [[horizontalism]].{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109–117}} Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various [[grassroots]] movements that are more or less based on horizontalism, although not explicitly anarchist, respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. In contrast with the \\'\\'big-A anarchism\\'\\' of the classical era, the newly coined term \\'\\'small-a anarchism\\'\\' signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to [[classical anarchists]] such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] to justify their opinions. Those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=145–149}}\\n\\nThe decision-making process of small anarchist [[affinity group]]s plays a significant tactical role.{{sfn|Williams|2019|pp=109, 119}} Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics, goals and values. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strikes]] as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=119–121}}\\n\\n[[File:Entering Free Capitol Hill.jpg|thumb|An entrance to the [[Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone]], a Temporary Autonomous Zone established during the [[George Floyd protests]]]]\\nAs in the past, newspapers and journals are used, but anarchists have gone [[online]] in the [[World Wide Web]] to spread their message.

During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s (TAZ), spaces where art, poetry and [[surrealism]] are blended to display the anarchist ideal.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1p=139|2a1=Mattern|2y=2019|2p=596|3a1=Williams|3y=2018|3pp=5–6}} As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action.{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2012|1p=250|2a1=Williams|2y=2019|2p=119}} Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds.{{sfn|Williams|2019|p=122}} Adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a [[carnivalesque]] atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.{{sfn|Morland|2004|p=37–38}}\\n\\n== Key issues ==\\n{{main|Issues in anarchism}}\\n<!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. -->\\nAs anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, schools of thought, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. Its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]]. The compatibility of [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Marshall|1y=1993|1p=565|2a1=Honderich|2y=1995|2p=31|3a1=Meltzer|3y=2000|3p=50|4a1=Goodway|4y=2006|4p=4|5a1=Newman|5y=2010|5p=53}} [[Anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and communism|communism]], [[collectivism]], [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]] and [[trade unionism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[God|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[Veganarchism|veganism]], or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as [[civilisation]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]]) and the [[Anarchism and statist democracy|democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.{{sfn|De George|2005|pp=31–32}}\\n\\n=== Gender, sexuality and free love ===\\n{{see also|Anarchism and issues related to love and sex}}\\n[[File:Emilearmand01.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Émile Armand]], a French individualist anarchist who propounded the virtues of free love in the Parisian anarchist milieu of the early 20th century]]\\nAs gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy, anarchism is obliged to address, analyse and oppose the suppression of one\\'s autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|p=603}}\\n\\nSexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists; the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} Sexual violence was, however, a concern for anarchists, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], who opposed age of consent laws, believing they would benefit predatory men.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=178}} A historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was [[free love]]. In contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support [[polyamory]] and [[queer anarchism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Nicholas|1y=2019|1p=611|2a1=Jeppesen|2a2=Nazar|2y=2012|2pp=175–176}} Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women\\'s sexual freedom and pleasure.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–176}} Those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists and other activists slept in beds together.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|p=177}} Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States. However, some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love.{{sfn|Jeppesen|Nazar|2012|pp=175–177}} Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, pro-choice (utilising a contemporary term) and had a similar agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on [[suffrage]], but they were nonetheless supportive of one another.{{sfn|Kinna2019|pp=166–167}}\\n\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the [[second wave of feminism]], radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalised groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=609–611}} With the [[third wave of feminism]], sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, yielding a [[post-structuralist]] critique of sexual normality.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=610–611}} However, some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation.{{sfn|Nicholas|2019|pp=616–617}}\\n\\n=== Anarchism and education ===\\n{{main|Anarchism and education}}\\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: none; background: none; float: right;\"\\n|+ Anarchist vs. statist perspectives on education<br><small>Ruth Kinna (2019){{sfn|Kinna|2019|p=97}}</small>\\n|-\\n!scope=\"col\"|\\n!scope=\"col\"|Anarchist education\\n!scope=\"col\"|State education\\n|-\\n|Concept || Education as self-mastery || Education as service\\n|-\\n|Management || Community based || State run\\n|-\\n|Methods || Practice-based learning || Vocational training\\n|-\\n|Aims || Being a critical member of society || Being a productive member of society\\n|}\\nThe interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider proper education, one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kinna|1y=2019|1pp=83–85|2a2=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=514–515, 520}} Anarchist writers such as [[William Godwin]] (\\'\\'[[Political Justice]]\\'\\') and [[Max Stirner]] (\"[[The False Principle of Our Education]]\") attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.{{sfnm|1a1=Suissa|1y=2019|1pp=514, 521|2a1=Kinna|2y=2019|2pp=83–86|3a1=Marshall|3y=1993|3p=222}}\\n\\nIn 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker [[Francisco Ferrer]] established the [[Escuela Moderna]] in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–512}} Ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster [[class consciousness]] among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. Nonetheless, his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of [[Modern School (United States)|modern schools]] around the world.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=511–514}} Christian anarchist [[Leo Tolstoy]], who published the essay \\'\\'Education and Culture\\'\\', also established a similar school with its founding principle being that \"for education to be effective it had to be free\".{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=517–518}} In a similar token, A. S. Neill founded what became the [[Summerhill School]] in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=518–519}}\\n\\nAnarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child\\'s right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions. However, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation. Ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism, along with other critiques of government and nationalism.{{sfnm|1a1=Avrich|1y=1980|1pp=3–33|2a1=Suissa|2y=2019|2pp=519–522}}\\n\\nLate 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ([[Colin Ward]], [[Herbert Read]] and [[Paul Goodman]]) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children\\'s creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in [[consumerism]] as part of a consumer society.{{sfn|Kinna|2019|pp=89–96}} Contemporary anarchists such as Ward have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socio-economic inequality.{{sfn|Ward|1973|pp=39–48}}\\n\\nWhile few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day, major tenets of anarchist schools, among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. Judith Suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools, namely the Free Skool Santa Cruz in the United States which is part of a wider American-Canadian network of schools, the Self-Managed Learning College in Brighton, England and the Paideia School in Spain.{{sfn|Suissa|2019|pp=523–526}}\\n\\n=== Anarchism and the state ===\\n<!-- Important! Strive to explain how anarchists perceive authority and oppression and why they reject them. Jun (2019), p. 41. -->\\nObjection to the [[State (polity)|state]] and its institutions is a \\'\\'[[sine qua non]]\\'\\' of anarchism.{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=1971|1p=14|2a1=Jun|2y=2019|2pp=29–30}} Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is [[Open government|open]] or [[Transparency (behavior)|transparent]], as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the [[ruling class]] is distinct from the rest of society.{{sfn|Jun|2019|pp=32–38}}\\n\\nSpecific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary. [[Robert Paul Wolff]] believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate while [[A. John Simmons]] and [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], who leaned toward philosophical anarchism, believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus, although they saw this as highly unlikely.{{sfn|Wendt|2020|p=2}}\\n\\n=== Anarchism and art ===\\n{{see also|Anarchism and the arts}}\\n[[File:Apple Harvest by Camille Pissarro.jpg|thumb|340px|\\'\\'Les chataigniers a Osny\\'\\' (1888) by anarchist painter Camille Pissarro, an example of blending anarchism and art]]\\nThe connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists, surrealists and others.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=592}} In literature, anarchism was mostly associated with the [[New Apocalyptics]] and the [[neo-romanticism]] movement.{{snf|Gifford|2019|p=577}} In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk.{{sfn|AllMusic}} Anarchists such as [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Herbert Read]] argued that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=592–593}}\\n\\nOther anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|p=593}} In his book \\'\\'Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas\\'\\', Chris Robé claims that \"anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism\".{{sfn|Robé|2017|p=44}} Throughout the 20th century, many prominent anarchists ([[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Gustav Landauer]] and [[Camillo Berneri]]) and publications such as \\'\\'[[Anarchy (magazine)|Anarchy]]\\'\\' wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.{{sfn|Miller|Dirlik|Rosemont|Augustyn|Duignan|Lotha|2019|p=1}}\\n\\nThree overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists. It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies, serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect.{{sfn|Mattern|2019|pp=593–596}} The 19th-century [[neo-impressionist]] movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=78}} In \\'\\'Les chataigniers a Osny\\'\\' by anarchist painter [[Camille Pissarro]], the blending of aestetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community.{{sfn|Antliff|1998|p=99}}\\n\\n== Criticism{{anchor|Criticisms}}==\\n{{multiple image\\n | direction = horizontal\\n | alignment = center\\n | perrow = 2\\n | total_width = 350\\n | image2 = Bertrand Russell 1957.jpg\\n | image1 = Karl Marx 001.jpg\\n | footer = [[Karl Marx]] (left), called anarchism \"schoolboy asininity\" while [[Bertrand Russell]] (right), argued that anarchism was unable to provide all the services that government does}}\\nThe most common critique of anarchism is that humans can not self govern and a state is necessary for human survival.{{sfn|Peterson|1987|p=238}} Philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] supported this critique, noting that \"[p]eace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government\".{{sfn|Peterson|1987|p=238}} Another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self-governing. [[Colin Ward]] responds that major anarchist thinkers advocated [[Anarchist federalism|federalism]].{{sfn|Ward|2004|p=78}}\\n\\nPhilosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism. Fiala\\'s other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world, i.e. at protests, but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically. This line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory. While it advocates for no-one to \\'\\'archiei\\'\\', if accepted by the many, then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self-contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual, hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.{{sfn|Fiala|2017|loc=\"4. Objections and Replies\"}}\\n\\nPhilosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro-anarchist books such as [[A. John Simmons]]\\' \\'\\'Moral Principles and Political Obligations\\'\\'.{{sfn|Klosko|1999|p=536}} Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious. Edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate.{{sfnm|1a1=Klosko|1y=1999|1p=536|2a1=Kristjánsson|2y=2000|2p=896}} In \\'\\'The Problem of Political Authority\\'\\', [[Michael Huemer]] defends philosophical anarchism,{{sfn|Dagger|2018|p=35}} claiming that \"political authority is a moral illusion\".{{sfn|Rogers|2020|p=}}\\n\\nAnother criticism is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority as first articulated in an 1886 article for the \\'\\'[[North American Review]]\\'\\' by Frances L. Ferguson.{{sfn|Ferguson|1886}} [[Joseph Raz]] argues that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=37}} Raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities\\' successful and mistaken instruction.{{sfn|Gans|1992|p=38}} Anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable, nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment.{{sfn|Gans|1992|pp=34, 38}} Anarchist perception of human nature, rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive, overly simplistic and unrealistic, respectively.{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}} Classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering.{{sfn|Lucy|2020|p=162}} \\n\\nAcademic [[John Molyneux (academic)|John Molyneux]] notes in his book \\'\\'Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism\\'\\' that \"anarchism cannot win\", believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.{{sfn|Dodds|2011}} The Marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has an utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values. According to the Marxist view, that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence. Marxists argue that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act. In the anarchist vision, the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining.{{sfn|Baár|Falina|Janowski|Kopeček|2016|p=488}} Anarchism is also seen by Marxists as unrealistic and overly idealistic; [[Karl Marx|Marx]] described it as \"schoolboy asininity\".{{sfn|Brinn|2020|p=206}}\\n\\n== See also ==\\n{{Portal|Anarchism|Libertarianism}}\\n*
